            Yass, Jesus! is a faith and sexuality affirming podcast that
            believes you don&apos;t have to pick between gay and God. Hosts,
            Daniel Franzese (Actor, Mean Girls, Looking) and Azariah Southworth
            (former host, The Remix on TBN) meet each week in this hilarious
            take on a Sunday service to explore big questions and find out what
            it means to be a Christ-loving member of the LGBTQIA+ community
            during these divided times.
